Pearls AQI
Predictor 
Let’s predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) in
 your city in the next 3 days, using a 100
% serverless stack. 


=== PAGE 2 ===
The following is a high level
 overview for you to achieve this 
PROJECT


=== PAGE 3 ===
Write a Python script that:
3 ->Stores these features in the Feature store
You may want to explore Hopsworks or Vertex AI (Free tiers)
2 -> Computes features from this raw data
(aka model inputs), and targets (aka model
outputs) 
Include time-based features (hour, day, month) and 
derived features like AQI change rate.
Feature pipeline
1 -> Fetches raw weather and pollutant data
from an external API like AQICN or
OpenWeather
(The above api is just an example, you may need to explore other options too)


=== PAGE 4 ===
Run the feature script from step 1 for a
 range of past dates, to generate 
training data for your ML models.
Backfill historical (features,
targets)


=== PAGE 5 ===
Write a Python script that:
3 -> Stores the trained model in the Model
Registry.
1 -> Fetches historical (features, targets)from
the Feature Store.
2 -> Trains and evaluate the best ML model
possible for this data
Experiment with Scikit-learn models (Random Forest, Ridge Regression) and 
TensorFlow/PyTorch for advanced models.
 Evaluate performance using RMSE, MAE, and R².
Training pipeline


=== PAGE 6 ===
Create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically
runs
-> the feature script every hour, and
 -> the training script every day.
Some popular and free CI/CD tools that you can
 use are Apache Airflow and Github Actions but 
you are encouraged to explore other tools too
Automate pipeline runs


=== PAGE 7 ===
 Your app
1 -> Loads the model and features from
the *Feature Store*,
2 -> Computes model predictions and
shows them on a simple and
descriptive dashboard.
3 -> Use Streamlit/Gradio and 
Flask/FastApi for the web app
Web app to show model
predictions

Some Guidelines
Perform EDA to identify trends.
You should use a variety of forecasting models, from statistical
 modelling to deep learning models 
Use SHAP or LIME for feature importance explanations.
Add alerts for hazardous AQI levels
Final Submissions:
1. End-to-end AQI prediction system.
2. A scalable, automated pipeline.
3. An interactive dashboard showcasing real-time 
and forecasted AQI data.
4. A detailed report documenting everything you
 managed to achieve
